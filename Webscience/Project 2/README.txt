Dear user,

Running: 
Just run the analyzer.py.

Notes:
The Files folder should contain the input dot-file,
The Input folder contains generated files (they are generated again if deleted)
The Output folder contains the output csv-file after running the program 
	- This can easily be imported into Excel for analysis
